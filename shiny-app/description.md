This app allows to compute the sample sizes for a simple one-sided z test 
described in https://github.com/kkmann/sample-size-calculation-under-uncertainty
available. 
EP = expected power, MEU = maximal expected utility, quantile = prior quantile approach, 
MCID = simple power on minimal clinically important difference.
